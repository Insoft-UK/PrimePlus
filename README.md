**P+** is a pre-processor utility designed to improve code maintainability and readability in the HP Prime Programming Language (PPL). PPL+ also allows one to define regular expressions to assist in the preprocessing workflow. The final output is a compact, optimized PPL program file tailored to the HP Primeâ€™s limited storage capacity.
